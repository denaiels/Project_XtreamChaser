**Description:**

Xtream Chaser is my final project for the Human-Computer Interaction course in my Semester 4 of Computer Science Major at BINUS University. The project is to make a website design using HTML, CSS, and jQuery to showcase a new upcoming game called Xtream Chaser. My website has 5 pages, Homepage, Gallery, Characters, Lore, and Pre-Register Beta. The website is not yet connected to any database so it cannot receive any input of data, so this is just the design and prototype.

**How to Open:**
1. Open index.html using browser
2. Navigate through the website :)

**Screenshots:**

In case you don't want to open the HTML by yourself, I have provided screenshots of all the pages of my website. Here it is...
